Install grub (theres a installation executable in the win32-tools.zip), and then in menu.lst of grub's configuration copy the following into the script:



title New jonax kernel
root(hdx,y)						//Replace x with the hard drive number and y with the partition number
kernel /..../new jonax kernel/bin/NJkernel.bin 		//be careful: this is case sensitive
boot



make changes as necessary, then restart the computer and boot into NJkernel!
If you are using the new version of Grub (GRUB 2 which is not included with New Jonax Kernel currently) then here is the script:

menuentry "New Jonax Kernel"{
	root = (hdx,y)
	multiboot /...../NJkernel.bin
	boot
}
